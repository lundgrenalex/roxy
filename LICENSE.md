# Crypto Rebel License (CRL) v0.7

By syncing this repo you’re joining the Crypto Rebel Syndicate — welcome to the club. Here’s the pact:

1. **Freedom to Fork**: Copy, modify, and deploy the code in any chain or multiverse you like. No permission slips, no gatekeepers.
2. **Cred for the Crew**: Keep the credits intact. Mention "Roxy" and the original authors when you go-to-mainnet or publish derivatives.
3. **No Rugpulls**: If you ship changes, don’t sneak in malicious payloads or telemetry that eats users’ bags. Plain-language changelog required for major releases.
4. **Open the Ports**: Improvements to core proxy logic or protocol support must stay open source under this same license for at least 24 blocks after you deploy them anywhere public.
5. **Define Your Risk**: Software runs as-is — no warranties, no liability, no hand-holding. You fork it, you own the consequences.

Any dispute goes to binding on-chain governance (or whatever mutually agreed off-chain process looks least dystopian). If a clause gets voided, the rest still stand tall.

Stay sovereign. Ship responsibly.
